Understanding Java Access Modifiers
Let's understand the access modifiers in Java by a simple table.

Access Modifier 	within class	    within package	    outside package by subclass only	    outside package
Private	                Y	                N	                        N	                            N
Default	                Y	                Y	                        N	                            N
Protected	            Y	                Y	                        Y	                            N
Public	                Y	                Y	                        Y	                            Y

A class cannot be private or protected except nested class.
We are not writing Default if we want to make default access.
