Abstract class in Java
A class which is declared as abstract is known as an abstract class. It can have abstract and non-abstract methods.
It needs to be extended and its method implemented. It cannot be instantiated.

Points to Remember
* An abstract class must be declared with an abstract keyword.
* It can have abstract and non-abstract methods.
* It cannot be instantiated. (can not make object of abstract class)
* It can have constructors and static methods also. (constructors can not be abstract)
* It can have final methods which will force the subclass not to change the body of the method.
* Abstract class can inherit (extends) abstract class. You mustn't implement in this time abstract methods.

Rule: If there is an abstract method in a class, that class must be abstract.

Rule: If you are extending an abstract class that has an abstract method, you must either provide the implementation
of the method or make this class abstract.
