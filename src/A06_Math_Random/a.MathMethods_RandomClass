Math Class

Method              Description
Math.abs()          It will return the Absolute value of the given value.
Math.max()          It returns the Largest of two values.
Math.min()          It is used to return the Smallest of two values.
Math.round()        It is used to round of the decimal numbers to the nearest value.
Math.sqrt()         It is used to return the square root of a number.
Math.pow()          It returns the value of first argument raised to the power to second argument.
Math.ceil()         It is used to find the smallest integer value that is greater than or equal to the argument
                    or mathematical integer.
Math.floor()        It is used to find the largest integer value which is less than
                    or equal to the argument and is equal to the mathematical integer of a double value.
Math.random()       It returns a double value with a positive sign, greater than or equal to 0.0 and less than 1.0.

(int)(Math.random()*n)                            Formula of random number between zero and n
(int)( Math.random() * ((max-min)+1) ) + min        Formula of random number between to ranges

Random Class

Random random = new Random();       initialize. if you will write Random(seed), it will give all time same random number

random.nextInt()                    random integer if you will write .nextInt(bound), it will give (0 <= n < bound) random n.
random.nextFloat()                  random Float
