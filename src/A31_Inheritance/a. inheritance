//Note: Multiple inheritance is not supported in Java through class.

//There are 5 types of inheritance in Java:
	1. Single
	2. Multilevel
	3. Hierarchical
	4. Multiple (No in Java)
	5. Hybrid	(No in Java)

// Inheritance should be used only if the relationship is-a is maintained throughout the lifetime of the objects involved;
 otherwise, aggregation is the best choice.

// final classes can not inherit. But we can inherit final attribute/field in class
  // and you know that the final attributes can not reassign after initial assignment 
  	//in definition or in constructor.

// Final methods can not override or modified
