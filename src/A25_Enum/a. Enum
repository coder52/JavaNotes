Enum is a class, so you can make what you make in class. But its default modifier of constructor is private
you can not make it public but you can make it protected.
You can use this keyword also.

Points to remember for Java Enum
    Enum improves type safety
    Enum can be easily used in switch
    Enum can be traversed
    Enum can have fields, constructors and methods
    Enum may implement many interfaces but cannot extend any class because it internally extends Enum class

Note: Java compiler internally adds values(), valueOf() and ordinal() methods within the enum at compile time.
It internally creates a static and final class for the enum.
    public enum Season { WINTER, SPRING, SUMMER, FALL }
    Season.values()         konstantlarin objectini verir yani for-each dongusunde kullanabilirsin.
    Season.FALL.ordinal()   enumun icinde ki FALL konstutunun indexini verir. Bu ornekte 3.
    Season.valueOf("WINTER")             -->   WINTER
    Season.valueOf("WINTER").ordinal()   -->   0

If you put main() method inside the enum, you can run the enum directly.

Constructor of enum type is private. If you don't declare private compiler internally creates private constructor.
That's why we can NOT create the instance of Enum by new keyword.
