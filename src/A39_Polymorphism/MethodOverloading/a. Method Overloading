There are two ways to overload the method in java

    1.By changing number of arguments
    2.By changing the data type

In java, Method Overloading is not possible by changing the return type of the method only.

Note: Compile Time Error is better than Run Time Error. So, java compiler renders compiler time error
if you declare the same method having same parameters.

You can have any number of main methods in a class by method overloading.
But JVM calls main() method which receives string array as arguments only.
